# JMC3 Notes

## Information

These are notes taken during my third year of the Mathematics and Computer Science (Pure Mathematics and Computational Logic) undergraduate course in Imperial College London. You can download them with the links below, or by navigating to the various PDFs in the repository.

## Legend

N - live-TeXed with updated notes within a day of any lecture; post-processed post-lecture with official notes whenever possible

L - live-TeXed with updated notes within an hour of any lecture; unprocessed post-lecture and merely rough transcripts but will be revamped post-term

T - post-TeXed with notes to be uploaded post-term

## Disclaimer

This is my first attempt at live-TeXing notes, so errors and typos are definitely prevalent, most of which probably being solely my fault. If you discovered any, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request, or alternatively contact me via email at dka316@ic.ac.uk and I will surely fix them within a day.
