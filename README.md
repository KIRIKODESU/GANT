# Lecture notes for Geometry, Algebra, and Number Theory

## Information

### Description

The following lecture notes are taken during my third and fourth year in the MEng Joint Mathematics and Computing (Pure Mathematics and Computational Logic) course in Imperial College London. You can download them via the links below, or by navigating to their respective files within the repository.

### Disclaimer

This is my second year at lecture scribing, so errors and typos are definitely prevalent, most of which have myself to blame. If you discover any, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request, or alternatively contact me via email at dka316@ic.ac.uk and I will surely fix them within a day.
